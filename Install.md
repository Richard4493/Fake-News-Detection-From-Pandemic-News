#Installation 

Since we are building the library FakeNewsDetection , so it can not be used alone
but only by incorporating it into other programs. To compile the program some
dependency libraries like nltk , sklearn ,pandas, pickle etc are needed. These li-
braries can be installed during compile time using "/pip install lib-name /" command.
